****SYSTEMiX Bot****
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based conveersational AI app: 
An Augmented chatbot assistant to spark short conversations on Systems Thinking, Systemic Design, Systems Theory and Systems Innovation from your private knowledge database
This app uses AI Retrieval Augmented Generation to index and query from an uploaded corpus at Vectara database

During an International AI Hackathon by NNGroup, the mission was to develop advanced RAG apps and chatbots, integrating cutting-edge technologies such as Vectara, LlamaIndex, Together AI, and Unstructured.io.

Built this GenAI app using the Query and Summarization APIs and leveraging the Chat API to efficiently retrieve information from the Vectara corpus, providing accurate breif responses to your inquiries. I seamlessly imported data into a Vectara corpus, utilizing its's Indexing API.

Vectara’s newest embedding model BOOMERANG has been used which encodes text from the data as “vector embeddings” and is used to power the high performance retrieval process that is part of the RAG pipeline.

UNSTRUCTURED is a Python library that brings advanced preprocessing of various file types, and simplifies the ingest of data in RAG pipelines.
